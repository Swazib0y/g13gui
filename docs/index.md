# G13 Configurator

## What is this?

This is the companion application for configuring a Logitech G13 using the G13 user space driver originally written by ecraven, and available at https://github.com/jtgans/g13.

This tool allows you to:

  - Graphically plan out a keymapping
  - Save multiple profiles
  - Use the LCD with pluggable dbus-based applications
  - Switch profiles using the LCD

All wrapped up in a glorious Gtk 3.0 interface.

Please note: this is an early version of the application and as such it is still in heavy development.

## Design Docs

At the moment, our design docs are a bit sparse, but there is some useful stuff
in here, such as:
